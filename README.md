# Rian's Respite Web ðŸª´
My silly personal website that functions as my creative sandbox. It is hosted on vercel and you can check it out [here](https://rians-respite-web.vercel.app/) :)

Features:
- A bar with interactive elements
- An underwater aquarium
- A dictionary game (WIP)

## Getting Started

Run the NextJS front-end:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Run the Python back-end:
```bash
cd python-backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
